# Beanie-boop Norm!


### As a group we asked came up with the following as our guiding principles:

  * *What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)? Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?*
    
    &nbsp;Direct communication (voice or Slack) ASAP to avoid further issues.  


  * *What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.*

    &nbsp;Take a break/step back, go for a walk, run.
    
    &nbsp;If break doesn’t help, direct communication (voice or Slack) 
    ASAP to group member(s) to &nbsp;avoid further issues.
    
    &nbsp;If group communication doesn’t work, get in touch with Erik/John/other.

  * *What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?
Have a Gitmaster, i.e., sole person to approve git PRs*

  &nbsp;Slack PR communication
  
  &nbsp;Communicate all PRs on Slack, asking Gitmaster (or other team member) to review
  
  &nbsp;Gitmaster to review PR and send communication via Slack
  
  &nbsp;After approval of PR, Gitmaster communicates via Slack everyone should pull from&nbsp;master

  * *When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?*

  &nbsp;Individually, after 15 min of research.
  
  &nbsp;In the group, ask members to help solve the problem (using online resources).
  
  &nbsp;After everybody in the group has tried to solve the problem, we will then open a ticket.
  
  * *How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)? Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?*

  &nbsp;Yes, it’s okay, as long as we continue to check Slack to ensure we have the most up-to-date master.

  * *What time does this group have daily stand up?*

  &nbsp;Once before work and once before end of the day.
