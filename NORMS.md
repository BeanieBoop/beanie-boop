Establishing Norms


Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
Direct communication (voice or Slack) ASAP to avoid further issues.

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.
Take a break/step back.
If break doesn’t help, direct communication (voice or Slack) ASAP to group member(s) to avoid further issues.
If group communication doesn’t work, get in touch with Erik/John/other.

What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?
Have a Gitmaster, i.e., sole person to approve git PRs
Slack PR communication
Communicate all PRs on Slack, asking Gitmaster to review
Gitmaster to review PRand send communication via Slack
After approval of PR, Gitmaster to communicate via Slack that everyone should pull the latest master.

When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
ANSWER:
Individually, after 15 min of research.
In the group, ask members to help solve the problem (using online resources).
After everybody in the group has tried to solve the problem, we will then open a ticket.

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?
Alternate between pairing and solo work, but during solo work, stay in breakout room, so any questions can be asked (can mute and/or turn off camera during this time though).
Will discuss pair programming needs during daily stand up.

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?
Yes, it’s okay, as long as we continue to check Slack to ensure we have the most up-to-date master

What time does this group have daily stand up?
Once before work and once before end of the day.
