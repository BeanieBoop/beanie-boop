    ## Setup

     You may like what we have done to learn from or for a starting point for your own diabolical shopper clone. No judgement. If so this is how you get things started:
     
    Run the following commands* in your shell of choice:
     ```
     npm install
     node server/seed.js
     NODE_ENV='development' npm run build-client-watch & npm run start-server
     
     *Checkout package.json and under scripts you should see a host of commands which cover webpack integration as well as testing! 
     ```
     
  ## Checkout our deployed site!
